## Technology Stack

APC uses the following technologies:

- **JUCE 8** - Cross-platform audio plugin framework
- **Visage** - Planned native C++ UI framework (not yet implemented)
- **WebView2** - HTML5 Canvas-based UI framework
- **CMake** - Build system
- **PowerShell** - Automation scripts
- **YAML** - Configuration and knowledge base
- **Markdown** - Documentation and workflows

### Visage Integration (Planned)

Visage is a modern, high-performance UI framework for C++ applications. We plan to integrate Visage as an alternative to WebView for native UI rendering. Currently, Visage is included as a Git submodule but is not yet implemented in the workflow system. Contributions towards Visage integration are welcome once the core system is more stable.
