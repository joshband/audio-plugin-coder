Mode 1 (WSOLA Pitch-Shifter) - Dual-window time-stretching with correlation matching, 128-4096 sample windows. Mode 2 (Looping Delay) - Pitch-shifted loops with 64-sample crossfades, tap-tempo sync. Mode 3 (Spectral) - 4096-point FFT phase vocoder with quantization, warping, pitch shifting. REVERB FIXED: Replaced incorrect JUCE reverb with proper Dattorro topology (Griesinger/4 input diffusers, 8 main delays, dual LFOs). BUFFER CORRECTED: Increased from 256 to 384,000 samples (8 seconds @ 48kHz). GRAIN ENGINE FIXED: Cubic size scaling, proper position mapping, linear interpolation for smooth pitch shifting. Based on comprehensive analysis of Mutable Instruments Clouds source code (https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack)."

    "rationale": "WebView framework selected for CloudWash due to: (1) High complexity (5/5) with 13 parameters requiring sophisticated layout, (2) 4 distinct processing modes needing clear visual distinction and mode indicator, (3) Modern/clean aesthetic requirement from ideation phase favors WebView's design flexibility, (4) Rich visualization opportunities (grain activity, spectral display, freeze state LED), (5) Interactive controls benefit from web-based UI patterns. While Visage could handle the parameter count, WebView provides superior visual feedback and mode-switching UX for this complex granular processor.",
