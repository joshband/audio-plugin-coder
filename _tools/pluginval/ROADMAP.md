# Roadmap

There are lots of ways pluginval can be improved, some of these are listed below but we're open to Discussions on others.

You can help get there by issuing PRs or [funding](FUNDING.md) development.

- #### Integration of real-time safety checking (via RTsan or rtcheck)
- #### Improved stack trace/crash reporting
- #### Acceptance testing using input files and reference output files
- #### Automatic integration of Asan/Tsan on platforms that allow it
- #### More tests/logging
- #### Integration with CTest
- #### Improved command-line handling and json config file support
