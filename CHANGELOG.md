### Known Limitations / Future Work

The following features were designed but not fully implemented:

- **Phase 4: macOS Installer Creation** - NOT IMPLEMENTED
  - Requires macOS for DMG/PKG creation (`hdiutil`, `pkgbuild`, `productbuild`)
  - Code signing requires Apple Developer certificate
  - Can be built on macOS using prepared structure from GitHub artifacts
  - **TODO**: Add macOS installer creation to GitHub Actions workflow

- **Phase 5: Linux Package Creation** - NOT IMPLEMENTED
  - Requires Linux for AppImage/DEB creation (`appimagetool`, `dpkg-deb`)
  - Can be built on Linux using prepared structure from GitHub artifacts
  - **TODO**: Add Linux package creation to GitHub Actions workflow

- **GitHub Actions Installer Creation** - NOT IMPLEMENTED
  - Current workflow creates ZIP distributions only
  - Windows installer (.exe) created locally via PowerShell script
  - **TODO**: Add installer creation steps to GitHub Actions for all platforms
  - This would enable fully automated release with installers

- **GitHub Actions Build Failures** - KNOWN ISSUES
  - macOS build fails: `JUCEModuleSupport.cmake` not found during CMake configuration
  - Linux build fails: `libwebkit2gtk` package compatibility issues on Ubuntu 24.04
